			<p id="paragraph">Here is a <a href="https://bustownmodern.com/collections/view-all/products/christian-dior-new-york-1960s-grey-wool-coat">link</a> to a page that was my inspiration. It is good because it has css and this assignment was with html only. I see I receive errors in the html checker for obsolete html that should use css, however it still works for align left for the div. It tells me the 55% used for the image should expect a number instead, however this still works in html if the page is at max width, it starts to get wonky when the page is made smaller - with a number the image stays the same size and the text moves to the bottom when the page is adjusted smaller width.
