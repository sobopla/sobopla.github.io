			<p id="paragraph">Here is a <a href="https://bustownmodern.com/collections/view-all/products/christian-dior-new-york-1960s-grey-wool-coat">link</a> to a page that was my inspiration. It is good because it has css and this assignment was with html only. I was looking into creating a shopping cart website which would need button links to a checkout page, which I could set up with a form. The hover images would use javascript I believe. (Trying to figure out how to make the table stay a set size when screen is resized.)
